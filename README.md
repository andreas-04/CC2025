## Description 

> Sketch Key is a web application game to utilize AI in creating images based on a simple prompt. User compete for the best and most creative image. 
> Data is recycled into the system.

## Objective 

Art and Innovation

The art is the images that users create and get cleaned up using AI

The innovation is using the images that are created as randomization tools to use in TLS communication. 
Additionally, the drawings based on the prompt can be a data point that is mined to improve the data used in the image generator or just to be sold (?). 
    This is based on the idea of capcha to improve image recognition. But this is more creative fuel for AI to learn from.


# Outline

- Given a small prompt (no AI used), users compete and draw a creative piece of art and compete against random or non random friends. 

- The images that are created get refined using generative AI (who just wants to vote on stick figures). 
- The images are then voted on (how are these voted? Are users voting for themselves?) and winners are recylced.
     - Users are going to need to have accounted to store scores or what is the use in playing if not to have a high score. 

## Phase I 
- Defining the prompt


# Demo

# Tools Used
- React Router (React, Vite, ReactRouter)
- Django RESTapi framework. 
- Containerized using docker and 


# Future Improvements
- Developing own AI model to be used
- Finalizing TLS communication using randomized values from the user.
